# Gamebreaker &middot; ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/sevora/gamebreaker) ![GitHub repo size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/sevora/gamebreaker)
The objective of this project is to create interactive pages that can solve traditional games by having the user input the state of the game. 

Each gamebreaker will be first made with a prototype on either [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) or [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and later be made as an interactive page hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Games to break
### Sudoku
Sudoku is a logic-based puzzle where the player gets a 9x9 board. The goal of the game is to fill the entire board with digits 1-9 where no repeating digit occurs in all the rows, columns, and 3x3 sub-grids. [The gamebreaker page is available here.](https://sevora.github.io/gamebreaker/sudoku/)

### Wordle
Wordle is a word puzzle where a five-letter word must be guessed within six attempts according to clues which are the color of each letter. A green letter means that the letter is correct and in the right spot, a yellow means the letter is in the word but is on the wrong spot, and a gray means the letter isn't in the word. [The wordle solver is available here.](https://sevora.github.io/wordle/)

### Adding more later
Other games will be added later. I only work with one game and game-breaker at a time.

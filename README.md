# Gamebreaker &middot; ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/sevora/gamebreaker) ![GitHub repo size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/sevora/gamebreaker)
The objective of this project is to create interactive pages that can solve traditional games by having the user input the state of the game. 

Each gamebreaker will be first made with a prototype on either [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) or [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and later be made as an interactive page hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Games to break
### Sudoku
Sudoku is a logic-based puzzle where the player gets a 9x9 board. The goal of the game is to fill the entire board with digits 1-9 where no repeating digit occurs in all the rows, columns, and 3x3 sub-grids. Currently working on the game-breaker prototype.

### Adding more later
Other games will be added later. I only work with one game and game-breaker at a time.
